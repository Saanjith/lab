      "As IndyCar’s top earner ($2.5-3.0 million a year according to Racer.com) the 40-year-old Dixon is well compensated for performing the tasks that come with the job but this year, aside from interviews and a few other unavoidable commitments, he has been free to focus on driving.\n",

      "“If anything, for me, it becomes more (motivation),” said Dixon, who will start Sunday second on the grid between pole sitter Marco Andretti and Japan’s Takuma Sato, winner of the 2017 Indy 500. “I don’t know why that is, I don’t feel like I am close to being done but I do think that at this point you are seeing there are less years than when I started.\n",

      "\n",
      "There’s a lot to talk about with di Grassi. He’s an outspoken proponent of electric vehicles, previously helping to develop Formula E, push forward the AI racing circuit Roborace and is now developing an international electric race scooter series. He’s seemingly focused on justifying the benefits of electric vehicles in the name of the environment and acts as a Clear Air Advocate for the U.N. and is organizing a technology and business event for a zero-carbon future in Latin America called Zero Summit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Di Grassi is a racer in Formula E and a former champion, taking the podium in 2016. Before racing for the series, he helped develop the vehicles used in Formula E. Now, even with his plate full of other projects, he continues to compete in the electric F1 series.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last time he spoke at a TechCrunch event, he talked extensively on Roborace’s development and arrival. At the time he was the CEO of Roborace, and now, nearly two years later, Roborace still seems like a far-fetched idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Di Grassi teamed up with former F1 driver Alex Wurz for a different racing series involving electric scooters. Called eSkootr Championship, the series is said to feature purpose-built scooters that are capable of speeds up to 100 km/h. The pair, along with motorsport entrepreneur CEO Hrag Sarikissian, and COO Khalil Beschir, an F1 broadcaster and former A1 GP racing driver, hope the series’ lower cost of entry will draw racers from different backgrounds and disciplines.\n",

Chapel Hill on Monday became the first major university to pivot to online classes after reopening in person after it reported at least four clusters of outbreaks of COVID-19 in student living spaces. The school reported 130 student cases in the past week, a significant increase from the 10 cases it reported on campus in the week leading up to the start of class. Many universities that had planned on bringing students back for the fall semester have canceled or heavily modified those plans in recent weeks.

      "Racing Point team boss Otmar Szafnaeur praised Perez, who is known as Checo, saying: \"Checo's established his reputation as a tenacious racer and together we have enjoyed some fantastic moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there was ever a sniff of a podium, Checo was ready to pounce, and those five podiums represent some of the finest days in the history of this team. Outside of the car, Checo is a true character and a good friend, and it's been a pleasure working with him for such a long time.\"\n",

      "Andrew Benson, Chief F1 writer\n",
      "\n",
      "These are dramatic and fast-moving times at the Racing Point team, and signing Vettel - as they are believed to have done - is a big statement of intent for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Team owner Lawrence Stroll is a Canadian billionaire businessman who has a reputation for getting what he wants and not minding who he treads on to get there.\n",
      "\n",
      "His treatment of Perez in this scenario is in the best ruthless traditions of a sport famously dubbed the \"Piranha Club\" by former McLaren boss Ron Dennis.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Perez who triggered the administration process that allowed Stroll to take over the team in the summer of 2018 - and his move, which ousted former owner Vijay Mallya, was co-ordinated with senior team personnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only last October, Stroll gave Perez a new contract for another three years with the team. Perez seemed an ideal fit for a midfield outfit - he was quick enough, a solid points scorer, and he brought with him sizeable funding from his Mexican backers, including Carlos Slim, the world's second richest man.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Ferrari's decision to dispense with Vettel before this season had even started changed the landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vettel had been expecting to enter negotiations over a new contract with Ferrari and was caught by surprise when team boss Mattia Binotto rang him up and said he was surplus to requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Racing Point's 2020, meanwhile, has been packed with controversy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their car angered rivals when it was unveiled in pre-season testing in February because it was clearly a carbon-copy of last year's Mercedes, a fact the team made no attempt to disguise.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the season made its belated start after the peak of the coronavirus crisis had subsided, the car was protested by Renault, and Racing Point were found guilty of illegally copying Mercedes' 2019 brake ducts, and docked 15 points and fined 400,000 euros.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivals protested against that verdict, seeking further clarifications of the rules, and the last of these protests was withdrawn by Ferrari only last weekend after the confirmation by governing body the FIA of rules intended to prevent such a close copy of a rivals' car being legal in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, the Racing Point has emerged, on average, as the third fastest car of 2019. The team have not capitalised on its performance as they might have, but Perez's team-mate Lance Stroll - Lawrence's son - lies fourth in the championship, as do Racing Point in the constructors' table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lawrence Stroll took over Aston Martin earlier this year and has grand ambitions to turn around the famous British sports car company, which has stumbled from one financial crisis to the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Renaming his F1 team after the historic brand is one part of that plan, and Vettel has clearly been sold on the proposals laid out for him by the team's owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vettel's reputation is not what it was, after three mistake-prone years and being usurped at Ferrari by Charles Leclerc. And if he wanted to stay in F1, it was his only hope of a semi-competitive car. But he will believe he can help the team make even more progress over the coming years.\n"
